# TODO conservative field test - particle conserves energy as it travels in
# the modulating field
# TODO untrapped particle test - particle moves at the frequency
# of a time-oscillating field
# TODO maybe single particle test - that we can in fact hit resonance
# for a single arbitrary ion in a pseudopotential
